*Execution of the Task 4*


*Use the following instructions to get the gtkwave window*


ls - to check the contents of the folder


iverilog rajath.v rajath_tb.v - to simulate the verilog code and to check the errors


./a.out - to get the output and make vcd file to be ready open

*Lets move on to the execution Stage with Waveforms obtained for running the gtkwave rajath.vcd*


1. When instantiated module is selected we get all the registers and wires as shown in the below figure
