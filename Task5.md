**Final Task to Carry out the GLS - GateLevelSimulation**

**THEORY ABOUT GLS:**
Gate-level simulation in VLSI involves meticulously analyzing the behavior of a digital circuit by focusing on the interactions between individual logic gates, flip-flops, and other fundamental components. It's like zooming in to the finest level of detail, examining how signals propagate through each gate to verify the circuit's timing, power usage, and overall functionality. This process ensures that the design operates correctly, detects any errors or issues early on, and enables optimization for performance and compatibility with specific hardware platforms before actual fabrication.



**Synthesis directory check is mandatory.**

it should contain
  -  Gatelevel netlist
  -  standard cell library
  -  Yosys Synthesis Script
